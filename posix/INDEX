This directory (together with ../include) contains
a bit of extra functionality, mostly Posix functions
not present in Ape. 

math9.[ch]
Implementation of fceil() as APE only defines
ceil() (for doubles). Maybe fceil() could be
instead added to APE.

pwriteread.[ch]
Reimplementation of pread() and pwrite() using
read and write in APE.

expat.h & expat_external.h - header files for
'libexpat'. Not needed if the library is installed
properly in /sys/include/ape and /$arch/lib/ape.
